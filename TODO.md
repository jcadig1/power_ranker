# Cleaning up code
### Website generation
- Maybe run rankings for previous week if not already saved somewhere ... ? Might be tricky if it rewrites over something you didn't want it to.


# Further Things to Develop

### Summary plot of rankings vs week
- read the txt files
- do both for power rankings and espn rankings
- maybe add to team page?

### Testing
- Implement some unit tests

### Error Handling
- Have more than zero error handling


### Explore other endpoints? 
- playerInfo, scoreboard, player/news, recentActivity, leagueSchedules, 
  teams, rosterInfo, schedule, polls, messageboard, boxscore, matchups,
	status, teams/pendingMoveBatches, tweets, stories, livescoring

### plot strength by position
